# Down-by-the-Bay

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say

"Did you ever see a goose
Kissing a moose?"
Down by the bay.

# Down-by-the-bay but with CAPS

DOWN BY THE BAY 
WHERE THE WATERMELONS GROW 
BACK TO MY HOME
I DARE NOT GO 
FOR IF I DO
MY MOTHER WILL SAY

"DID YOU EVER SEE A GOOSE 
KISSING A MOOSE?"
DOWN BY THE BAY!!!
